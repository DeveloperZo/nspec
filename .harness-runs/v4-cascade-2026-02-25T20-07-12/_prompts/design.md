# Design — Virtual Snack Game

Include these sections:
- Overview
- Architecture
- Component Breakdown
- Data Models
- Technology Choices

Guidelines:
- Match complexity to the project scope. A simple feature gets a simple design.
- Favor the simplest technology choices that satisfy the requirements. Do not over-engineer.
- Include code snippets and type definitions only for key interfaces and non-obvious logic.
- Stay aligned with the Requirements. Do not introduce features or infrastructure not required.
- Keep the document under 300 lines. If it's longer, you're over-specifying.
